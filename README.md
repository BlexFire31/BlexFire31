# 🔥 Hi, Im @BlexFire31 

I'm a young fireball, learning how the heck to use this teknologi stuff ┗|｀O′|┛
But I've always been a fan of it (SINCE I WAS 2 🤣) \(￣︶￣*\)) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### My Journey

I started off at age 12, learning python 🐍 because it was beginner friendly, awesome, and pretty powerful
A few months later, I learnt how the web works; a bit of javascript too
Then, I learnt flutter, AND I <3 IT... It is one of the best things to learn (imo) 🙃
Then i countinued to improve upon my skillset, learning more and more everyday

Then came hacking/exploiting 😈
(it was done in a controlled environment)
hacking was fun, but it also taught me A LOT about security
Now, i only do pen-testing of my own applications (no more bad hacking 😇)

### My Projects

Currently, working on a thing called "Domanda", which is a quiz website
somewhat similar to kahoot

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's absolutely great to see how tech is advancing constantly, and becoming better,
hopefully i'll be as good as it is one day 😉
