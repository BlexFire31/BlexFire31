# 🔥 Hi, Im [@BlexFire31](https://github.com/BlexFire31)  

I'm a young fireball, still learning how to use tecknology  
But I've been a fan of it for as long as i can remember \\(￣︶￣*\\))

### My Journey

I started off at age 12, learning python 🐍 because it was beginner friendly, awesome, and pretty powerful.  
A few months later, I learnt how the web works; a bit of javascript too.  
Then, I learnt flutter, and it's been one of the best things i have learnt imo.  
Then i countinued to improve upon my skillset, learning more and more whenever I can...

Then came hacking 😈 
(it was done in a controlled environment).  
hacking was fun, but it also taught me A LOT about security. 
Now, i only do pen-testing of my own applications  
(no more bad hacking for me 😇). 

### My Projects

Currently, working on a project called "Domanda", which is a quiz website, primarily focused on secuirty, 
somewhat similar to kahoot.

### Other hobbies

It's absolutely great to see how tech is advancing constantly, and becoming better, 
hopefully i'll be as good as it is one day :\).
